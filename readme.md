#Steam Unplayed Games

A quick hack up page to display games from Steam using the Steam Web API. 

##Usage
Rename the `config.ini.dist` to `config.ini` and put in your API key and 64bit SteamID.  

The easiest way to get your 64bit Steam ID, is to load your profile page as XML.  
For example, [http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon1024/?xml=1](http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon1024/?xml=1)
